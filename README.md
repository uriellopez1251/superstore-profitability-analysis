# 📊 Superstore Profitability & Return Analysis (Tableau)
 
## 🚀 Project Overview
In this business simulation, I acted as a Data Analyst hired to save a struggling retail company—**Superstore**—from bankruptcy. Using Tableau and real-world datasets, I explored key metrics like profitability, advertising efficiency, and return rates to recommend data-driven strategies that could help turn the business around.

This project replicates a real consulting scenario and shows my ability to make informed decisions through impactful visualizations.
